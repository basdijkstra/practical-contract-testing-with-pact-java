      ##### Exercises for section: Continuous Integration #####

      # TODO: Add a step that runs the contract generation tests
      #   for the customer-consumer
      # The working directory is ./customer-consumer
      # The command you need to use is the same as you used to
      #   run tests locally: 'mvn clean test'

      # TODO: Add a step that publishes the generated contract to the Pact Broker.
      # Use the pactflow/actions/publish-pact-files@v2 GitHub Action to do so.
      # The pactfiles are in ./customer-consumer/target/pacts
      # The PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL and PACT_BROKER_TOKEN should be defined as
      #   repository secrets in your repository. See the documentation linked to
      #   in the video transcripts for detailed instructions on how to do that.

      # TODO: Add a step that run the provider verification tests.
      # Use the same command you used to run the tests locally.

      # TODO: push the updates to your repository and check the GitHub Actions output

      # TODO: check your Pact Broker to see if the contract is published correctly, and
      #   if the contract has been successfully verified by the provider

      #   deployed to the staging environment
